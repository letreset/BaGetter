# Authentication

BaGetter supports multiple authentication modes for controlling access to your NuGet feed. You can use Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for enterprise single sign-on, local database-backed accounts, or a hybrid of both.

## Authentication modes

The `Authentication.Mode` setting controls which authentication mechanisms are active:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Config` | (Default) Config-file-based auth. Uses API keys and basic auth credentials defined in appsettings.json. No database-backed users. |
| `Entra` | Azure Entra ID (OIDC) authentication only. Users sign in via their organization's Entra ID tenant. |
| `Local` | Local database-backed accounts only. Admins create user accounts with passwords. |
| `Hybrid` | Both Entra ID and local accounts are active. Users can sign in with either method. |

```json
{
    "Authentication": {
        "Mode": "Hybrid"
    }
}
```

:::info

When `Mode` is `Config` (or the `Authentication` section is omitted), BaGetter uses `Credentials` and `ApiKeys` from configuration. Existing deployments require no changes.

## Azure Entra ID setup

### Prerequisites

1. An Azure Entra ID (Azure AD) tenant
2. An App Registration in your tenant
3. A client secret for the App Registration
4. (Optional) App Roles defined in the App Registration for role-based group sync

### Step 1: Create an App Registration

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) > **Microsoft Entra ID** > **App registrations** > **New registration**
2. Set the **Name** (e.g., "BaGetter NuGet Feed")
3. Set **Supported account types** to "Accounts in this organizational directory only" (single tenant)
4. Set the **Redirect URI** to `https://your-bagetter-url/signin-oidc` (type: Web)
5. Click **Register**
6. Note the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** from the overview page

### Step 2: Create a client secret

1. In your App Registration, go to **Certificates & secrets** > **Client secrets** > **New client secret**
2. Add a description and expiration period
3. Copy the secret **Value** immediately (it will not be shown again)

### Step 3: Define App Roles (recommended)

App Roles allow you to manage admin access and group memberships through Azure AD instead of manually in BaGetter. Roles appear in the `roles` claim of the ID token.

1. In your App Registration, go to **App roles** > **Create app role**
2. Create roles matching your team structure:

| Display Name | Value | Allowed Member Types | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Administrator | `Admin` | Users/Groups | Full admin access to BaGetter |
| Frontend Team | `TeamFrontend` | Users/Groups | Auto-joins "Frontend Team" group |
| Backend Team | `TeamBackend` | Users/Groups | Auto-joins "Backend Team" group |

3. In **Enterprise Applications** > your app > **Users and groups**, assign users or Entra security groups to the appropriate App Roles.

:::info

The `Admin` App Role is special and hardcoded. Any user whose token contains a role with value `Admin` is automatically granted `IsAdmin = true` and full access to all feeds. This cannot be overridden. All other role values work through group membership and feed permissions.

:::

### Step 4: Configure BaGetter

Add the Entra configuration to `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
    "Authentication": {
        "Mode": "Entra",
        "Entra": {
            "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
            "TenantId": "<your-tenant-id>",
            "ClientId": "<your-client-id>",
            "ClientSecret": "<your-client-secret>",
            "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
            "RoleClaim": "roles"
        }
    }
}
```

:::warning

Do not store the `ClientSecret` in `appsettings.json` in production. Use environment variables, Docker secrets, or a secrets manager instead:

```shell
# Environment variable
Authentication__Entra__ClientSecret=your-client-secret

# Docker secret file
/run/secrets/Authentication__Entra__ClientSecret
```

:::

### Entra configuration reference

| Setting | Required | Default | Description |
|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `Instance` | Yes | -- | The Azure AD instance URL (e.g., `https://login.microsoftonline.com/`) |
| `TenantId` | Yes | -- | Your Azure AD tenant ID |
| `ClientId` | Yes | -- | The application (client) ID from your App Registration |
| `ClientSecret` | Yes | -- | The client secret value |
| `CallbackPath` | No | `/signin-oidc` | The OIDC callback path. Must match the redirect URI in your App Registration. |
| `RoleClaim` | No | `roles` | The token claim name to read App Roles from. Change only if your identity provider uses a non-standard claim name. |

### How Entra authentication works

When a user signs in via Entra ID:

1. The user is redirected to Microsoft's login page
2. After successful authentication, the OIDC token is validated
3. BaGetter automatically provisions a local user record linked to the Entra Object ID, capturing the user's email from the token's `email`, `mail`, or UPN claim (used for [token expiry notifications](#expiry-notifications))
4. The `roles` claim is read from the token
5. **Admin sync (bidirectional):** If the token contains the `Admin` role, `IsAdmin` is set to `true`. If not, `IsAdmin` is set to `false`. Admin status is always driven by the token — there is no way to persist admin for an Entra user outside of the App Role.
6. **Group membership sync (full reconciliation):** The user is added to all BaGetter groups whose `AppRoleValue` matches a role in the token, and removed from role-linked groups whose role is no longer present. Manually-managed groups (no `AppRoleValue`) are never touched.
7. A session cookie (`BaGetter.Auth`) is issued with a 60-minute sliding expiration

## Local accounts

When `Mode` is `Local` or `Hybrid`, administrators can create local user accounts. Local accounts use bcrypt-hashed passwords and support account lockout after repeated failed login attempts. Each account can also carry an optional email address (set from the admin **Accounts** page), used for [token expiry notifications](#expiry-notifications).

### Account lockout

Local accounts are protected by an automatic lockout mechanism:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `MaxFailedAttempts` | `5` | Number of consecutive failed logins before lockout |
| `LockoutMinutes` | `15` | Duration (in minutes) that the account remains locked |

```json
{
    "Authentication": {
        "Mode": "Local",
        "MaxFailedAttempts": 5,
        "LockoutMinutes": 15
    }
}
```

After `MaxFailedAttempts` consecutive failed logins, the account is locked for `LockoutMinutes`. The counter resets on successful login.

## Personal access tokens (PATs)

Personal access tokens allow users to authenticate with NuGet CLI tools without using their interactive login credentials. PATs are available for both Entra and local users.

### How PATs work

- Users generate PATs from the web UI (available when signed in)
- Each token has a name and an expiration date
- The plaintext token is shown only once at creation time
- Tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes in the database
- Tokens can be revoked at any time

### Token expiry

The maximum allowed token lifetime is controlled by the `MaxTokenExpiryDays` setting:

```json
{
    "Authentication": {
        "MaxTokenExpiryDays": 365
    }
}
```

### Expiry notifications

BaGetter can email token owners before their personal access tokens expire, so they can create a replacement before clients start failing authentication. This requires:

- [Email](configuration.md#email) to be configured (`Email:Type` set to `Smtp` or `Graph`). When email is disabled, the scanner does not run.
- The token owner to have a stored email address. Local users get one from the admin **Accounts** page; Entra users have it derived from their token's `email`, `mail`, or UPN claim on sign-in. Owners without an email address are skipped (with a warning logged).

A background scanner wakes every `ScanIntervalHours` and emails owners as each configured threshold (whole days before expiry) is crossed. Each threshold is sent at most once per token.

```json
{
    "Email": {
        "Type": "Smtp"
        // ... see the Email configuration section
    },
    "PatExpiryNotification": {
        "Enabled": true,
        "ScanIntervalHours": 24,
        "NotificationDaysBeforeExpiry": [ 14, 7, 2, 0 ],
        "WebBaseUrl": "https://packages.example.com"
    }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `Enabled` | `true` | Whether the scanner runs. When `false`, no scanning or emailing happens regardless of email configuration. |
| `ScanIntervalHours` | `1` | How often (in hours) the scanner looks for tokens nearing expiry. Minimum `1`. |
| `NotificationDaysBeforeExpiry` | `[14, 7, 2, 0]` | Thresholds, in whole days before expiry, at which an owner is emailed. `0` means the expiry day itself. Values must be distinct and zero or greater. |
| `WebBaseUrl` | -- | Public base URL of this site (e.g. `https://packages.example.com`), used to link owners to the token page. Must be an absolute `http(s)` URL when set. Omit for a name-only reference. |

:::info

The scanner runs outside an HTTP request and cannot infer the site URL, so `WebBaseUrl` must be configured for notification emails to include a working link.

:::

### Using PATs with NuGet clients

Use the PAT as the password when configuring a NuGet source. The username can be any non-empty string:

```shell
# dotnet CLI
dotnet nuget add source "https://your-bagetter-url/v3/index.json" \
    --name "BaGetter" \
    --username "pat" \
    --password "<your-personal-access-token>"

# NuGet CLI
nuget sources add -Name "BaGetter" \
    -Source "https://your-bagetter-url/v3/index.json" \
    -UserName "pat" \
    -Password "<your-personal-access-token>"
```

To push packages using a PAT:

```shell
dotnet nuget push -s https://your-bagetter-url/v3/index.json \
    -k <your-personal-access-token> \
    package.1.0.0.nupkg
```

## Feed permissions

BaGetter uses a feed-scoped permission model. Permissions can be granted to individual users or groups.

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `Pull` | Can restore/download packages from the feed |
| `Push` | Can publish packages to the feed |
| `Admin` | Full control, including managing users, groups, and permissions |

Permissions are evaluated by the authorization handler on every NuGet API request. Users without the required permission for an operation receive a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` response.

### Group permissions

Permissions can be assigned to groups. A user inherits permissions from all groups they belong to. Groups come in two flavors:

- **Role-linked groups** have an `AppRoleValue` set (e.g., `"TeamFrontend"`). Membership for Entra users is automatically synchronized from the token's `roles` claim on each sign-in. Admins cannot manually add or remove Entra users from these groups — membership is controlled exclusively by Azure AD App Role assignments. Local users can still be manually added.
- **Manually-managed groups** have no `AppRoleValue`. Membership is managed entirely through the BaGetter admin UI for all user types.

This design lets Azure AD control *who has what role*, while BaGetter controls *what each role grants* (per-feed push/pull permissions).

## Full configuration reference

```json
{
    "Authentication": {
        "Mode": "Hybrid",
        "Entra": {
            "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
            "TenantId": "<tenant-id>",
            "ClientId": "<client-id>",
            "ClientSecret": "<client-secret>",
            "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
            "RoleClaim": "roles"
        },
        "MaxTokenExpiryDays": 365,
        "MaxFailedAttempts": 5,
        "LockoutMinutes": 15,
        "Credentials": [
            {
                "Username": "legacy-user",
                "Password": "legacy-password"
            }
        ],
        "ApiKeys": [
            {
                "Key": "legacy-api-key"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

:::info

The `Credentials` and `ApiKeys` arrays are only used when `Mode` is `Config`. When `Mode` is `Entra`, `Local`, or `Hybrid`, authentication is handled through the database-backed user system and PATs.

:::

## Environment variables

All authentication settings can be provided via environment variables using the double-underscore (`__`) separator:

| Environment Variable | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `Authentication__Mode` | Authentication mode (`Config`, `Entra`, `Local`, `Hybrid`) |
| `Authentication__Entra__Instance` | Azure AD instance URL |
| `Authentication__Entra__TenantId` | Azure AD tenant ID |
| `Authentication__Entra__ClientId` | Application (client) ID |
| `Authentication__Entra__ClientSecret` | Client secret |
| `Authentication__Entra__CallbackPath` | OIDC callback path |
| `Authentication__Entra__RoleClaim` | Token claim name for App Roles (default: `roles`) |
| `Authentication__MaxTokenExpiryDays` | Maximum PAT lifetime in days |
| `Authentication__MaxFailedAttempts` | Failed login threshold for lockout |
| `Authentication__LockoutMinutes` | Lockout duration in minutes |

## Docker Compose example

```yaml
services:
  bagetter:
    image: letreset/bagetter:latest
    ports:
      - "5000:8080"
    environment:
      - Database__Type=PostgreSql
      - Database__ConnectionString=Host=db;Database=bagetter;Username=bagetter;Password=secret
      - Storage__Type=FileSystem
      - Storage__Path=/srv/baget/packages
      - Authentication__Mode=Entra
      - Authentication__Entra__Instance=https://login.microsoftonline.com/
      - Authentication__Entra__TenantId=your-tenant-id
      - Authentication__Entra__ClientId=your-client-id
      - Authentication__Entra__CallbackPath=/signin-oidc
      - Authentication__Entra__RoleClaim=roles
    volumes:
      - bagetter-data:/srv/baget
    secrets:
      - entra_client_secret

secrets:
  entra_client_secret:
    file: ./secrets/entra-client-secret.txt
```

When using Docker secrets, create the secret file at the path matching the configuration key:

```shell
/run/secrets/Authentication__Entra__ClientSecret
```

## Database migrations

When upgrading from a version of BaGetter without authentication support, the required database tables (Users, Groups, UserGroups, PersonalAccessTokens, FeedPermissions) are created automatically on startup via EF Core migrations. No manual migration steps are needed.

## Troubleshooting

### "The 'TenantId' config is required for Entra authentication"

The `Authentication.Entra.TenantId` is missing or empty. Ensure your configuration or environment variables include the tenant ID from your Azure App Registration.

### "The 'ClientId' config is required for Entra authentication"

The `Authentication.Entra.ClientId` is missing or empty. Copy the Application (client) ID from the Azure Portal App Registration overview page.

### OIDC callback fails with "correlation failed"

This typically means the redirect URI in your Azure App Registration does not match the `CallbackPath` combined with your application's external URL. Verify:

1. The redirect URI in Azure is set to `https://your-external-url/signin-oidc`
2. Your reverse proxy (if any) is forwarding the `Host` header and the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header correctly
3. The application is using HTTPS in production

### App Roles are missing from the token

If users are not getting admin permissions or group memberships despite being assigned App Roles:

1. Verify that **App Roles** are defined in the App Registration under **App roles**
2. Verify users are assigned to the roles in **Enterprise Applications** > your app > **Users and groups**
3. Check that the token includes the `roles` claim (use [jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms) to decode a token)
4. Ensure the `RoleClaim` config matches the claim name in your token (default: `roles`)
5. Verify that BaGetter groups have the correct `AppRoleValue` set to match the role values in the token

### Admin role not granting access

The admin role value is hardcoded as `Admin` (case-sensitive). Verify your App Role in Azure AD has exactly `Admin` as the **Value** (not the display name).

### Local account is locked out

If a local account is locked after too many failed attempts, wait for the lockout period to expire (`LockoutMinutes`, default 15 minutes). An administrator can also re-enable the account from the user management page.

### NuGet client returns 401 Unauthorized

1. Verify the NuGet source is configured with valid credentials (username/password or PAT)
2. Check that the user has `Pull` permission on the feed
3. If using a PAT, verify it has not expired or been revoked
4. Ensure the `Mode` setting matches your authentication method (e.g., do not use `Credentials` when `Mode` is `Entra`)
